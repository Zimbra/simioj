;;; rpc - an RPC implementation that knows how to communicate will all servers (by their
;;;       ID) in the union of all the server-sets in the servers vector.
;;;       The RPC must implement the three-argument arity of all of the functions defined
;;;       in the RaftProtocol
;;; election-config - a map with the following entries [static]
;;;   :broadcast-timeout - time in ms for leader broadcast (if nil, no broadcasts are issued)
;;;   :election-timeout-min - minimum time in ms for election timeout
;;;   :election-timeout-max - maximum time in ms for election timeout
;;; timers - a map (wrapped in a [ref]) whose keys are timer keywords and whose
;;;    values are functions (run in a future).  They all take a callback function
;;;    that is part of the Election protocol if they timeout.
;;;    keys include:
;;;      :follower  (follower-state election timeout)
;;;      :candidate (candidate-state timeout)
;;;      :broadcast (leader-state send-broadcast timeout)
;;; servers-config - a map with the following entries [ref]
;;;   :servers - a vector that contains one or two sets of server-ids for all
;;;             servers in the Raft cluster.  if there is only one entry in the
;;;             servers vector that is the current config
;;;             If there are two entries in the servers vector, the first
;;;             entry is the current config and the second entry is the new
;;;             config that we are transitioning to
;;;   :state-machines - a map whose keys are unique state-machine identifiers and whose
;;;     values are state machine instances.
;;;   :leader - if not nil, using configured leader election protocol.  The value
;;;     should be the ID of ther server that is supposed to be the leader.
;;;
;;; server-state - a map that is persisted automatically as values are changed. [ref]
;;;   :state - :follower, :candidate, :leader
;;;   :current-term - latest term this server has seen.  initialized to 0 on first boot
;;;   :voted-for - candidate that received vote in current term (null if none)
;;;   :commit-index - index of highest log entry known to be committed.  Initialized
;;;     to 0, increases monotonically
;;;   :last-applied - map
;;;     keys = <state-machine-identifier>
;;;     values = map whose key is the state machine command (e.g., :patch)
;;;              and whose values are the highest log entry applied to the state
;;;              machine for that command.  They start at 0 and increase
;;;              monotonically. Restriction: Each state machine should operate
;;;              on just one type of command.  Multiple state machines MAY process the
;;;              same command.  That's OK, they will have different <state-machine-identifiers>
;;;              When this is implemented, values are just integers that reflect the latest
;;;              log entry that was processed by the state machine.
;;;   :last-leader-cmd-time - system time in ms when last cmd received from leader.
;;;      See spec, section 6, last paragraph.
;;; leader-state - a map that is persisted automatically as values are changed.  used only
;;;     if state = :leader [ref]
;;;   keys: <server-ids>
;;;   values: {
;;;     next-index <int>
;;;     match-index <int>
;;;   }
;;;   next-index is the index of the next log entry to send to that server
;;;   match-index is the index of the highest log entry known to be
;;;     replicated to that server.
